# Emoji

Emojis are a fun way to add visual interest to your documentation and make it more engaging for readers. You can use emojis to convey emotions, emphasize key points, or simply add a touch of personality to your content. In this guide, we'll show you how to use emojis in your markdown files and provide some examples of how you can incorporate them into your documentation. 

## Using Emojis in Markdown

To use emojis in your markdown files, you can simply insert the emoji code directly into your text. Emojis are represented by a unique code that starts with a colon `:` and ends with another colon `:`. For example, the code 

```md
:smile:
``` 
will display a smiling face emoji :smile:. You can find a list of available emojis and their corresponding codes on [Github emoji list](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908).
