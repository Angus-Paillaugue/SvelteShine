# Usage

To create magnificent tables, you don't have to use any custom component, just use the default markdown table like so :

```markdown
| Month    | Salary | Expenses | Savings |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| January  | $1450  | $1220    | $230    |
| February | $1640  | $1470    | $170    |
| March    | $1320  | $1200    | $120    |
```

## Result

And here is what it looks like :

| Month    | Salary | Expenses | Savings |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | ------- |
| January  | $1450  | $1220    | $230    |
| February | $1640  | $1470    | $170    |
| March    | $1320  | $1200    | $120    |
